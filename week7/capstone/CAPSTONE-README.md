# Capstone Project - Todo List

## Project Overview

This capstone project implements a Todo list application using JavaScript and follows the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The project focuses on creating a Todo list with various functionalities, such as adding items, removing items, and retrieving the list.

## Project Files

- `todo-list.js`: JavaScript file containing the implementation of the `ToDoList` class.
- `test-todo-list.js`: JavaScript file containing the Mocha and Chai test suite for the `ToDoList` class.

## Project Requirements

The following requirements are fulfilled by the project:

1. Implement a `ToDoList` class that handles the following functionalities:
   - Calling the list.
   - Adding an item to the list.
   - Adding multiple items to the list.
   - Removing the first item from the list.
   - Removing the last item from the list.
   - Removing a specific item from the list.
2. Use either Python or JavaScript for the project (JavaScript is chosen for this project).
3. Use Mocha and Chai for testing.
4. Utilize at least one of each of the following data types in the list: String, Number, Object/Dictionary, and Boolean.
5. Implement appropriate tests for each functionality using TDD.

## Test Results

The provided `test-todo-list.js` file contains the test suite for the `ToDoList` class. The tests cover the required functionalities and ensure that the implementation meets the specified requirements.

## Usage

To use the Todo list, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-project-repo-url).
2. Navigate to the project's root directory. (`cd your-project-directory`)
3. Install the required dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Initialize a new node.js project by running the following command: `npm init -y`
5. Install mocha chai chai as development dependencies by running the following command: `npm install mocha chai --save-dev`

## Running the Tests

To execute the test cases and ensure the functionality of the Todo list, follow these steps:

1. Run the tests by executing the following command: `npm test`.
2. Review the test results in the console and ensure that all tests pass successfully.

## Conclusion

This capstone project demonstrates the implementation of a Todo list application using JavaScript and TDD principles. By following the provided requirements and utilizing Mocha and Chai for testing, the project achieves the desired functionalities and ensures the correctness of the implementation.

For detailed code implementation, refer to the `todo-list.js` and `test-todo-list.js` files.
